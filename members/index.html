            <p>I am a biologist fascinated by the beauty and complexity of the microscopic world. To a large degree, cells are like tiny black boxes, and the genetic material (DNA molecules) are like super long threads of Christmas lights that are stuffed in a box thousands of times smaller. I am excited to understand the strategies cells use to fold their DNA molecules. This is like finding a way to turn on the Christmas lights in the tiny black box, learning the folding pattern of the thread, then figuring out the approaches cells take to complete this task. Outside of the lab, I enjoy walking everywhere, cooking new dishes, reading books, solving Rubik’s tubes, and Hula Hooping.</p>

            <p>I have always been drawn to science. I am very curious about how things work and why they work the way they do. I enjoy exploring how microbes manipulate and interact with their environment. As a research scientist, I have been able to use my skills to investigate many questions in microbiology. My early research involved understanding the biosynthesis and regulation of bacterial polysaccharide capsule and bacterial protein adhesins. I blended knowledge from those studies to probe how bacteria anchor polysaccharide adhesins to their cell surface. Here in the lab, I am currently trying to understand how proteins organize and protect the chromosome during growth and development. Outside the lab, I enjoy the outdoors, working-out, reading and playing piano. </p>

            <p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biochemistry with interests in data science and community health. After getting experience with various sciences in high school, I found that I enjoy small-scale biology the most! I'm interested by the mystery behind chromosome dynamics and the methods of visualizing these intricate movements. I plan to go to medical school to achieve my goals of understanding the complexity of science as well as improving healthcare around the world. In my free time, I enjoy writing novels, spending time with friends, and playing games. My favorite foods are cereal, cheesecake, and ice cream.</p>

            <p>I am a graduate student in GCDB program. Inside the lab, I study chromosome dynamics during bacterial growth and development. Specifically, I work on visualizing the three-dimensional world inside bacterial cells in which we can see how proteins work to fold the chromosome. Outside the lab, I enjoying reading, painting and LEGOing!</p>

            <p>I became interested in chromosome biology because chromosomes provide the blueprint for all life. Inside the lab, I study chromosome folding and dynamics using <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> as a model organism. Specifically, I am looking into how the SMC condensin complex contributes to chromosome organization and segregation. Outside of the lab, I like playing basketball, playing video games and reading.</p>

            <p>I am a graduate student in the Microbiology program. I am excited to learn how bacterial chromosomes are structured and how those structures provide bacteria with their unique “personalities”. I’ve always loved the amazing diversity of microorganisms, and the many and various strategies bacteria use to survive in the harsh world. I strive to understand how the basis of all living things – chromosomes – adapt to, evolve in, and perhaps even manipulate their environment according to their needs. Outside the lab I love working out, crocheting, and traveling around the world to try new foods</p>
