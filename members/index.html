      <p>I am a biologist fascinated by the beauty and complexity of the microscopic world. To a large degree, cells are like tiny black boxes, and the genetic materials (DNA molecules) are like super long threads of Christmas lights that are stuffed in a box thousands of times smaller. I am excited to understand the strategies cells use to fold their DNA molecules. This is like finding a way to turn on the Christmas lights in the tiny black box, learning the folding pattern of the thread, then figuring out the approaches cells take to accomplish this task. Outside of the lab, I enjoy walking everywhere, cooking new dishes, reading books, solving Rubik’s tubes, and Hula Hooping.</p>

      <p>I am a graduate student in the Microbiology program. I am excited to learn how bacterial chromosomes are structured and how those structures provide bacteria with their unique “personalities”. I’ve always loved the amazing diversity of microorganisms, and the many and various strategies bacteria use to survive in the harsh world. I strive to understand how the basis of all living things – chromosomes – adapt to, evolve in, and perhaps even manipulate their environment according to their needs. Outside the lab I love working out, crocheting, and traveling around the world to try new foods</p>
